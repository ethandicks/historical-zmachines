Zork Implementation Programs (also called Z-machines) for various vintage platforms

__What is this Repository?__

 This repository is a collection of Zork Implementation Programs for microcomputers with initial emphasis on 6502-based home computers.  Where possible, the source code is the original code from Infocom.  Where necessary, because the sources are lost, it is reconstructed from shipped binaries.  Reconstructed source will be identified in the comments.

__What is the Purpose of this Repository?__

 This collection is meant for education, discussion, and historical work, allowing researchers and students to study how code was made for these interactive fiction games and how differences between wildly disparate home computers was accomodated to be able to run the same game code across the entire list of supported machines. It is not considered to be under an open license.

Researchers are encouraged to share their discoveries about the information in this source code and the history of Infocom and its many innovative employees.

__How can I compile these programs?__

 Infocom used a number of different native and cross-assemblers for developing their ZIPs, and even on the same platform, the tools changed over time.  Essentially none of the original commercial tools in use in the early 1980s are available for purchase now, and some of the assembly code is written in dialects for particular assemblers (e.g. Avocet's XASM65.COM for CP/M and AD2500 for MS-DOS)
